//you can declare variables with let, var or const
// let - allows it to be changed/updated later in the script
//const - cannot be reassigned later in the script
//var - this is the similar to "let" and "const" difference is that var is function scope as opposed to the others that are block scope, this means you can call var outside a block but you can't call let and const.
