/* the === equality does not use type conversion like the == operator */
// == operator - the prompt here is a string
// const numNeighbours = prompt("How many neighbour countries does your country have?");
// if (numNeighbours == 1){
//     console.log("only 1 border");
// }else if (numNeighbours > 1){
//     console.log("more than 1 border");
// }else if (numNeighbours < 1){
//     console.log("No border");
// }
// === is an equality that checkes whether the two compared values are of the same type and value
//while == operator is a comaprison operator that only compares the values and doesn't care about the typeof
